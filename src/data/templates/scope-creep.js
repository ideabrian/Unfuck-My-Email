Hi {{client_name}},<br>
<br>
I hope you’re having a good week. I reviewed the email that you sent me about additional updates. I’m so glad that you’ve been happy with my work, and I’ve had a great time working on this project with you.<br>
<br>
I’ve made a few of the changes you listed, but {{update_one}} in addition will take me a few hours.<br>
<br>
I’m happy to do this for you so you don’t have to worry about it. In order to start, I just need you to approve a new scope of work to make sure that everything is covered and that we’re both on the same page for the changes that need to happen.<br>
<br>
I went ahead and included an updated scope to this email. If it looks alright, once it's signed and returned I can go ahead and keep working on the changes. If you’ve got questions, I’m happy to clarify the scope or get on a call to discuss it.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
{{name}}
