Hi {{client_name}},<br>
<br>
I wanted to check in and see what the status was on providing the items we talked about for the project.<br>
<br>
Since our original deadline passed {{day}}, we'll just need to update our timelines.<br>
<br>
On the current schedule, if I can get this info today, it will push the project back {{approximate_time}}. Please let me know if you need anything from me.<br>
<br>
As of right now, I’m unable to move forward with the project without these items.<br>
<br>
If you’re having any trouble, I’m happy to get on a call with you and see how I can help.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
{{name}}
