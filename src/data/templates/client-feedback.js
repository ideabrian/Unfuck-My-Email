Hi {{client_name}},<br>
<br>
Thanks so much for working with me on this project. I had a great time and I hope we can work together again!<br>
<br>
I've sent your final invoice over in a separate email for your review.<br>
<br>
And last but not least, I include a survey after every project to make sure I'm providing great service. It only takes 5 minutes (like actually 5 minutes), and really helps me make sure clients are happy.<br> 
<br>
You can fill it out by visiting this link: {{client_survey}}<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you've got any other questions â€” I'm happy to help you out!<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>
<br>
