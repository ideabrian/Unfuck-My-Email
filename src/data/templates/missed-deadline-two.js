Hi {{client_name}},<br>
<br>
I gave you a call earlier to see if there was any other information you needed from me in order to send over the items we talked about. I was wondering if you had time for a 30 minute call {{date}}, between {{time_one}} to discuss it.<br>
<br>
We’ve missed our deadline by {{number_of_days}}, and I really want to make sure that we’re able to stay within your timeframe.<br>
<br>
Right now, I’m unable to move forward with the project without the items we discussed.<br>
<br>
Please let me know if one of these times works for you to have a short meeting.<br>
<br>
Thanks so much,<br>
<br>
{{name}}
