Hey {{client_name}}, <br>
<br>
Thanks so much for taking the time to {{meeting_type}} the other day. I’m really {{project_feeling}} this project. I’ve taken the details from the proposal I sent you and included everything in the contract.<br>
<br>
I know contracts {{contract_feeling}}, but it's one document that lays everything out from the proposal, plus includes payment details, and the legal info to protect us both.<br>
<br>
The best part is it's all written in plain English — no legalese for me! <br>
<br>
I've attached the contract to this email.<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you’ve got any questions or concerns and I’ll be happy to clarify!<br>
<br>
I look forward to working together,<br>
<br>
